# Exercise-5: Multimodal Chatbot with Gradio

This project implements a multimodal chatbot using Gradio, capable of processing text, images, and audio inputs to generate intelligent responses.

## Description

The multimodal chatbot is designed to enhance interaction by integrating various forms of media input. It utilizes the Groq API and Gradio to deliver the following functionalities:

- **Text Processing:** Analyzes and understands user input in text form to provide relevant responses.
- **Image Analysis:** Interprets images uploaded by users to extract meaningful information and integrate it into responses.
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion:** Converts spoken language into text to allow for seamless audio input processing. *(Currently not operational)*
- **Intelligent Response Generation:** Combines insights from text, image, and audio inputs to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Gradio for an intuitive and accessible interface.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Quick analysis and response generation for interactive user experience.
- **Scalable and Extensible:** Easily adaptable to incorporate additional features or improvements.
